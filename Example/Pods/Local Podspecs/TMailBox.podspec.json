  "description": "TMailBox is an iOS library designed to ease the pain of dealing with e-mail protocols. TMailBox makes the process of sending e-mail easy by hiding the nasty details like MIME composition from you. Instead, there is a single method required to send a message. Checking e-mail on an IMAP server is a more complex beast, but MailCore makes the job much simpler by presenting everything as a set of objects like Messages, Folders and Accounts.",
